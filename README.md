# hack36 - Annual Hackathon
Theme - Smart Education

Project Description - 

This website brings together the students that want to learn something -- by those who are willing to teach.
It is different from the existing facilities such as udemy and other online course providers. 
Initially website would work on the college level, but can be expanded to city, national level.

The inspiration of the project is that we want to make use of the potential of the experience and knowledge of our SENIORS

We know final years are mostly free, but WILLING to share their knowledge and experience.
On the other hand 1st, 2nd and 3rd years are struggling and learning new technologies.


Why you would want this platfrom ? 

As a learner you would get a lot of instructors/tutors.
As a tutor you can share and help juniors and your peers. You skills will only enhance and you would greatly help someone.

Additional Problem solved - 
Government of India has recently announced a budget of 99,300 crores for skill development. This website would track the skills that are in demand, so that they can smartly invest.
