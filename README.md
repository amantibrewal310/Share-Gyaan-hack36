# ShareGyan - Skill Development Platform
hack36 2020 - Annual Hackathon of MNNIT ALLAHABAD

Theme - Smart Education
Project Name - ShareGyaan

Project Description - 

This website brings together the students who wants to learn something to those who are willing to teach/share/help.
It is different from the existing facilities such as udemy and other online course providers as you get to interact with the instructor/guide.

Initially website would work on the college level, but can be expanded to city, national level.
The inspiration of the project is that we want to make use of the potential of the experience and knowledge of the SENIORS.

We know final years are mostly free and WILLING to share their knowledge and experience that they have gained all over the years.
The problem is that there is no medium for them to interact with their juniors.
Also the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years are struggling and learning new technologies so they also look for some help.

# Why this platfrom is neccesary? 

->  As a learner you would get a lot of instructors/tutors and 
    all the help and direction you want.
->  As a tutor you can share and help juniors and your peers. 
    Their skills will only enhance and you would greatly help someone.

# Additional Problem solved -

Government of India has recently announced a budget of 99,300 crores for skill development. 
This website would track the skills that are in demand, people are eager to learn. 
The background Survey would let them know how they can invest.
